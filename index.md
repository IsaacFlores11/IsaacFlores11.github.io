### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 : Lab one was an introduction to C++ and, for many, coding; I talk about this lab because I experienced coding for the first time and got the satisfaction of producing a successful line of code. I learned how to print messages and learned about git commands. This lab taught me all the basics I would need to learn to succeed in the class.

* Lab 5 : Lab five has two parts. The first part was the area calculations. This lab was meaningful because it taught me how to implement equations and symbols in my code. It helped my understanding of spacing and correct format, as it could skew the numbers and make the machine misunderstand and prod the incorrect answers. Part 2 taught me how to use and implement strings into our code.

* Lab 7 : Lab seven was challenging. It had many variables which were hard to organize. Out of all the labs, it gave me the most challenging time, making it difficult to set the correct parameters for the parking meters. Lab 7 included different allowed parking times, exceptions, and the days they applied. This lab helped me understand if and else statements and helped me improve how I format my codes.
